For only experimenting with C++ language and to understand the concept of making/designing a compiler.

## Usage:
- Create a `dist` folder inside the current workspace directory.

- To compile and get the actual compiler, run: `g++ main.cpp dist/main`

- To use the output compiler: `./dist/main <FILE> or simply run ./dist/main ./lang.txt`
